Now in this challenge they gave the path of the files in their shell.
So in the shell in the path specified I found many directories and files and it is impossible to grep flag with each file name .
So for this the cmd is "grep 'picoCTF' -r ." 
In the above cmd -r indicates grep the text recursively ..
and the . indicates from the present directort.....

And after executind this cmd I got the flag...
