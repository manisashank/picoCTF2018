The name of the challenge is what base is this 
From the name we can assume that the challenge is related to the types of numbers like binary(base 2) decimal(base 10) hexadecimal(base 16)
octadecimal(base 8).
They asked us to connect to their servet using a link and port number I did it using the netcat...
Then first they gave a bunary and asked me to convert it to word .
We can do this by using the binary to ASCII converters which are present on the internet.
In the same way next they gave a hexadecimal and asked me to convert to word and then gave an octadecimal number to convert it to word if we solve it we finally get the flag....
