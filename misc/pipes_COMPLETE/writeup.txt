The name of the challenge is pipes 
Here they asked us to connect to their server through their link and port number
When we connect to that specific port we get a large text file .
now we should find the flag in this huge text.
To solve this we have 2 methods .
Method 1:
First taking all the text into a text file and find the flag using the cmd "egrep 'picoCTF' filename"
To take the text to a text file we use cmd "nc link portnumber > file.txt"
Method 2:
Second method is by using grep only but here we dont need to take the text to some text file
so the cmd is "nc link portnumber | grep picoCTF"





Then we get the flag that can be submitted...
